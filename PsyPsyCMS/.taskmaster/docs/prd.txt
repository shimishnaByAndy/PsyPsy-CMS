# PsyPsy CMS - Healthcare Management System PRD

## Overview
PsyPsy CMS is a comprehensive healthcare management system designed for medical professionals in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The system ensures full compliance with Canadian federal privacy legislation (PIPEDA), Quebec's Law 25 (An Act to modernize legislative provisions respecting the protection of personal information), and industry best practices for healthcare data management.

Located in Montreal, Quebec, the system addresses the unique regulatory landscape of Canadian healthcare by providing a unified platform that handles Personal Health Information (PHI) with proper encryption, audit trails, and multi-jurisdictional compliance spanning federal (PIPEDA) and provincial (Quebec Law 25) privacy laws.

The system solves the core problem of fragmented, non-compliant healthcare management tools by providing a Montreal-based solution that ensures all patient data remains within Quebec jurisdiction while meeting the stringent privacy and security requirements of Canadian healthcare regulations.
