Ensure data reflects real-world distributions (e.g., appointment frequency, client age ranges).\n\n4. **Format and Integration**: Provide seed data in formats compatible with the emulator (e.g., JSON, CSV, or direct database scripts). Include clear documentation for loading and resetting the data set.\n\n5. **Maintainability**: Structure data and scripts for easy extension and modification as new features or scenarios are added.\n\n6. **Compliance and Privacy**: Ensure all data is fully synthetic and does not contain any real or sensitive information.",

        "details": "1. **Review Compliance Requirements**: Analyze PIPEDA and Quebec Law 25 to extract actionable technical requirements, focusing on data residency, consent management, access logging, data subject rights (access, correction, deletion), and breach notification.\n\n2. **Map Requirements to Firebase MCP Capabilities**: Identify which Firebase MCP tools (Firestore, Storage, Authentication) and workflows are relevant for each compliance requirement. Document how each legal requirement is addressed by the current implementation or where gaps exist.\n\n3. **Design Test Scenarios**: For each mapped requirement, design test cases that simulate real-world compliance scenarios, such as:\n   - User requests for data access or deletion\n   - Consent withdrawal and audit trail verification\n   - Data export and residency checks\n   - Logging and notification of access or modification events\n\n4. **Implement Automated Tests**: Use the Firebase MCP tools to script and automate these scenarios. Where possible, leverage the emulator and seed data from Task 3 to ensure tests are realistic and repeatable. Ensure tests cover both typical and edge cases, including error handling and unauthorized access attempts.\n\n5. **Document Test Coverage and Results**: Maintain clear documentation of test cases, expected outcomes, and actual results. Highlight any compliance gaps or areas requiring remediation.\n\n6. **Iterate with Legal/Compliance Stakeholders**: Review test coverage and results with legal or compliance experts to confirm adequacy and adjust scenarios as needed.",

Implement authentication checks using `request.auth` to restrict all data operations to authenticated users only.\n3. Apply document-level access controls to ensure users (e.g., professionals, clients) can only access their own records, using rules like `allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId`.\n4. Integrate role-based permissions, differentiating access for clinicians, administrators, and clients via custom claims or user attributes (e.g., `request.auth.token.role`).\n5. Enforce data validation in rules to prevent malformed or unauthorized data writes, using checks on `request.resource.data` and `resource.data` for field-level integrity.\n6. Annotate rules with comments explaining intent and compliance rationale, supporting future audits and collaboration.\n7.

Integrate these workflows into package.json scripts (e.g., 'dev:emulator', 'test:emulator', 'export:emulator') for ease of use and consistency across environments.\n4. Document the process for exporting production data (using gcloud and gsutil) and converting it for emulator use, including handling metadata files and directory structure requirements.\n5. Provide guidance for LAN-based emulator access and port configuration to support multi-device testing.\n6.

Validate integration with CI by running emulator-based tests using the import/export scripts and confirming reproducibility.\n5.
