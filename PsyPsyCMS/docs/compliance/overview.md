}

// All PHI access is automatically logged
const accessPHI = (data: PHIData, userId: string, action: string) => {
  auditLogger.log({
    userId,
    action,
    dataType: 'PHI',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    ipAddress: getClientIP(),
    successful: true
  });
  
  return decryptPHI(data);

## Technical Implementation

### Encryption Standards
```rust
// AES-256-GCM implementation for PHI protection
pub struct EncryptionService {
    algorithm: &'static str = "AES-256-GCM",
    key_rotation_days: u32 = 90,
    backup_encryption: bool = true,
}

impl EncryptionService {
    pub fn encrypt_phi(&self, data: &[u8], key_id: &str) -> EncryptedData {
        // FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliant encryption
        aes_gcm::encrypt(data, &self.get_key(key_id))
    }
    
    pub fn audit_encryption_access(&self, key_id: &str, user_id: &str) {
        // Mandatory audit for all encryption key usage
        audit_logger::log_encryption_access(key_id, user_id);
    }
}
```

### Data Classification
```typescript
type DataClassification = 
  | 'public'           // No restrictions
  | 'internal'         // Organization-only
  | 'confidential'     // Limited access required
  | 'restricted'       // PHI/PII - highest protection
  | 'secret';          // Executive/legal only

interface ClassifiedData<T = any> {
  data: T;
  classification: DataClassification;
  phiMarkers: string[];           // Specific PHI field identification
  retentionPeriod: number;        // Retention in years
  geographicRestrictions: string[]; // Allowed processing regions
  consentRequired: boolean;       // Explicit consent needed
}
```

### Audit Trail Implementation
```typescript
interface AuditEvent {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  userId: string;
  action: 'create' | 'read' | 'update' | 'delete' | 'export' | 'access';
  resourceType: 'patient' | 'appointment' | 'professional' | 'system';
  resourceId: string;
  phiInvolved: boolean;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  result: 'success' | 'failure' | 'partial';
  metadata: {
    beforeState?: any;    // For update operations
    afterState?: any;     // For update operations
    reason?: string;      // For delete/access operations
    consentId?: string;   // For consent-based operations
  };
  complianceFlags: {
    hipaaAudit: boolean;
    quebecLaw25: boolean;
    dataResidency: boolean;
  };
}

// Automatic audit logging for all operations
const auditMiddleware = (action: string, resource: any) => {
  const event: AuditEvent = {
    id: generateUUID(),
    timestamp: new Date(),
    userId: getCurrentUser().id,
    action: action as any,
    resourceType: resource.type,
    resourceId: resource.id,
    phiInvolved: checkPHI(resource),
    ipAddress: getClientIP(),
    userAgent: getUserAgent(),
    result: 'success',
    metadata: {},
    complianceFlags: {
      hipaaAudit: checkPHI(resource),
      quebecLaw25: isQuebecResident(resource),
      dataResidency: verifyCanadianProcessing()
    }
  };
  
  auditLogger.log(event);
};
```
