  "font-size-xs": "12px",      // Captions, metadata
  "font-size-sm": "14px",      // Secondary text
  "font-size-base": "16px",    // Body text (minimum for accessibility)
  "font-size-lg": "18px",      // Large body text
  "font-size-xl": "20px",      // Subheadings
  "font-size-2xl": "24px",     // Section headings
