# Quick Test Execution Guide for Agents

## 🚀 **Immediate Actions for Testing Agent**

You are testing the **PsyPsyCMS Healthcare Management System** located at:
```
/Users/andreichira/Documents/Mobile_App_Dev/PsyPsy/CMS/PsyPsyCMS
```

### **Step 1: Navigate to Project**
```bash
cd /Users/andreichira/Documents/Mobile_App_Dev/PsyPsy/CMS/PsyPsyCMS
```

### **Step 2: Run Automated Test Suite**
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x scripts/automated-test-runner.js

# Run comprehensive automated tests
node scripts/automated-test-runner.js
```

### **Step 3: Review Generated Reports**
After tests complete, examine:
- `test-results/automated-test-report.json` (detailed data)
- `test-results/automated-test-report.md` (human-readable summary)

### **Step 4: Manual Verification Tests**
```bash
# Test development environment
npm run tauri dev
# → Verify app launches and UI loads properly

# Test build process
npm run build
# → Confirm TypeScript compilation succeeds

# Test specific healthcare workflows (if app is running)
# 1. Navigate to patient management
# 2. Create new patient record
# 3. Schedule appointment
# 4. Generate medical notes
# 5. Verify compliance markers appear
```
