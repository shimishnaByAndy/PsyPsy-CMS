# Active Context

## Current Development Phase
The project is currently in **Phase 1: Core Administration**. This phase focuses on:
- Setting up the authentication system
- Implementing basic user management functionality
- Creating the dashboard with key metrics
- Establishing essential system configuration

## Recent Changes

### Authentication System
- Implemented Parse Authentication integration
- Created AuthGuard and ProtectedRoute components
- Set up login, signup, and password reset flows

### Theming System
- Implemented theme context provider
- Added support for light/dark modes
- Added support for different skin types (default, bordered, glass)
- Added support for layout variations (vertical, horizontal)

### Darkone Template Integration
- Added Darkone UI components as reference implementations
- Created cursor rule to ensure Darkone is used only as a reference
- Fixed build errors related to direct imports from Darkone

### Navigation Components
- Refined DashboardNavbar implementation
- Maintained minimal UI approach with essential navigation controls
- Ensured proper functionality of sidenav toggles and configuration access
- Kept UserTypeSelector component for the tables/users page

### Build Configuration
- Identified proper build scripts in package.json
- Confirmed React application runs with `npm start`
- Confirmed Electron desktop version runs with `npm run electron:dev`
- No "dev" script defined in package.json (use "start" instead)

## Current Focus
- Completing the user management interface
- Building the dashboard with initial metrics
- Setting up the appointment monitoring view
- Creating the professional verification workflow

## Known Issues
- Build errors when attempting to directly import Darkone components
- Theme persistence issues on some page refreshes
- Authentication token expiration handling needs improvement
- Mobile responsiveness requires attention in some dashboard views
- Need to use correct npm scripts (`npm start` instead of `npm run dev`)

## Next Steps
1. Complete dashboard with core metrics
2. Implement the user management interface
3. Create appointment monitoring view
4. Develop professional verification workflow
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline for staging deployments
