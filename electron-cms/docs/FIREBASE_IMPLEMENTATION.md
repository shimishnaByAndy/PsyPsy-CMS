# Firebase Implementation for PsyPsy CMS

This document describes the complete Firebase implementation that replaces the Parse Server backend with Firebase/Firestore.

## Overview

The PsyPsy CMS has been migrated from Parse Server to Firebase, providing:
- **Firebase Authentication** for user management
- **Cloud Firestore** for database operations
- **Firebase Storage** for file uploads
- **Real-time subscriptions** for live data updates
- **Security rules** for data protection
- **Migration utilities** to transition from Parse

## Architecture

### Database Structure

The Firebase implementation uses a denormalized structure optimized for read performance:

```
/users/{userId}
├── Basic user data (email, role, displayName, etc.)
├── /clientProfile/{profileId}
│   └── Client-specific profile data
├── /professionalProfile/{profileId}
│   └── Professional-specific profile data
└── /sessions/{sessionId}
    └── User activity logs

/appointments/{appointmentId}
├── Appointment scheduling and status data
├── Client and professional references
└── /sessions/{sessionId}
    └── Session notes and outcomes

/timeSlots/{slotId}
└── Professional availability slots

/reviews/{reviewId}
└── Client reviews and ratings

/notifications/{notificationId}
└── User notifications

/systemConfig/{configId}
└── Application configuration (admin only)
```

### User Roles and Authentication

Three main user roles are supported:
- **admin**: Full system access
- **professional**: Healthcare providers
- **client**: Service seekers

Firebase Authentication manages user accounts while Firestore stores role-based profile information.

## Key Components

### Services Layer

#### Firebase Auth Service (`firebaseAuthService.js`)
- User registration and authentication
- Role-based profile creation
- Password reset functionality
- Session management

#### Firestore Service (`firestoreService.js`)
- Base service class for CRUD operations
- Real-time subscriptions using `onSnapshot`
- Batch operations for data consistency
- Generic implementation for reuse

#### Client Service (`firebaseClientService.js`)
- Client-specific operations
- Profile management in subcollections
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Statistics and analytics

#### Professional Service (`firebaseProfessionalService.js`)
- Professional profile management
- Availability and scheduling
- Certification and verification tracking
- Search by expertise and location

#### Appointment Service (`firebaseAppointmentService.js`)
- Appointment CRUD operations
- Status management (pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled)
- Session notes and outcomes
- Calendar integration support

### React Hooks Layer

#### Client Hooks (`useFirebaseClients.js`)
- Real-time client subscriptions
- Optimistic UI updates
- Search and filtering
- Statistics queries

#### Professional Hooks (`useFirebaseProfessionals.js`)
- Professional data management
- Real-time professional listings
- Advanced search capabilities
- Form validation helpers

#### Appointment Hooks (`useFirebaseAppointments.js`)
- Appointment management
- Status updates with optimistic UI
- Real-time appointment tracking
- Calendar integration

### UI Components

#### Data Grid Components
- `FirebaseClientsDataGrid`: Real-time client management interface
- `FirebaseProfessionalsDataGrid`: Professional directory with filtering
- Advanced search, sorting, and pagination

#### Dashboard Components
- `FirebaseDashboard`: Real-time analytics dashboard
- Statistics cards with live updates
- Charts and visualizations
- Role-based data views

#### Authentication Components
- `FirebaseLogin`: Firebase Auth-based login
- `FirebaseAuthGuard`: Route protection
- `FirebaseInitializer`: App initialization

## Security Implementation

### Firestore Security Rules

Comprehensive security rules protect data access:

```javascript
// Users can only access their own data
// Admins have full access
// Professionals can access client data for their appointments
allow read: if isAdminOrOwner(userId) || hasValidAppointment();

// Profile data follows strict access patterns
// Client profiles: owner + involved professionals + admins
// Professional profiles: public read, owner write
```

### Firebase Storage Rules

File upload security with size and type restrictions:
- Profile images: 10MB limit, image types only
- Professional documents: 50MB limit, document types only
- Appointment files: restricted to involved parties

## Migration from Parse Server

### Migration Utility

The `ParseToFirebaseMigration` class provides:
- Batch data migration with error handling
- Field mapping between Parse and Firebase formats
- Relationship preservation
- Migration validation and reporting

### Migration Script

Command-line script for data migration:

```bash
# Preview migration (dry run)
node scripts/migrate-parse-to-firebase.js --dry-run

# Migrate all data
node scripts/migrate-parse-to-firebase.js

# Migrate specific user types
node scripts/migrate-parse-to-firebase.js --user-type 3 --batch-size 25

# Use Firebase emulators
node scripts/migrate-parse-to-firebase.js --use-emulator
```

### Migration Process

1. **Preparation**
   - Backup existing Parse data
   - Configure Firebase project
   - Set up security rules
   - Configure indexes

2. **Data Migration**
   - Export users and profiles
   - Migrate appointments and relationships
   - Validate data consistency
   - Generate migration report

3. **Testing**
   - Verify data integrity
   - Test real-time functionality
   - Validate security rules
   - Performance testing

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy Firebase configuration
   - Update application to use Firebase
   - Monitor migration results
   - Handle any data inconsistencies

## Real-time Features

### Live Data Updates

Firebase implementation provides real-time updates:
- **Client dashboards** update automatically when new clients register
- **Professional listings** reflect changes immediately
- **Appointment status** updates in real-time across all connected clients
- **Statistics and analytics** update without page refresh
