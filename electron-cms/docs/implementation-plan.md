# PsyPsy CMS Implementation Plan (Display-Only First Approach)

## Project Overview
PsyPsy CMS is designed to facilitate appointment matching between mental health professionals and clients. This document outlines the implementation plan for the administrative dashboard that will manage users, professionals, appointments, and time slot offers.

## Core Data Entities
Based on the Parse Server database, the system works with these key entities:

- **Client** - Profile for users seeking mental health services
- **Appointment** - Service requests created by clients
- **TimeSlotOffer** - Proposed meeting times from professionals

This implementation will follow a **display-first approach**:
- Phase 1: Implement read-only functionality for all features
- Phase 2 (Future): Add edit/update capabilities after display features are complete
