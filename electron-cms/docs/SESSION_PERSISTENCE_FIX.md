# Session Persistence Fix - Hot Reload Authentication

## Problem Diagnosed ‚ùå

Your app wasn't keeping users logged in during hot reloads because:

1. **Global Window State**: `AuthGuard` used `window.__PSYPSY_AUTH_GUARD__` which gets reset on hot reload
2. **Development Mode Bypass**: Authentication was completely bypassed in development mode, masking the real issue
3. **Improper Session Restoration**: Session restoration was happening in the wrong place and not updating auth state properly
4. **Timing Issues**: Auth checks weren't waiting for session restoration to complete
5. **üî¥ ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: App.js `RedirectHandler` was still using the old `window.__PSYPSY_AUTH_GUARD__` global state for startup redirects

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. **Fixed AuthGuard.js**
- **Removed global window state** - Now uses React state that properly handles component lifecycle
- **Proper session restoration** - Checks for `Parse.User.current()` and attempts session restoration with `Parse.User.become()` if needed
- **Fixed development mode** - No longer bypasses authentication, shows real auth status
- **Better state management** - Uses `useState` with proper loading states and navigation handling

### 2. **Enhanced ParseInitializer.js**
- **Removed redundant session restoration** - Moved to AuthGuard where it belongs
- **Better logging** - Clearer debug messages with component prefixes
- **Focused responsibility** - Only handles Parse SDK initialization

### 3. **Updated parseService.js**
- **Default Remember Me** - Sets remember me to `true` by default for better UX
- **Enhanced logging** - Better debug information with service prefixes
- **Improved session management** - More reliable session token handling

### 4. **Fixed App Startup Redirects**
- **Created AuthenticatedRedirect component** - Proper authentication-aware redirect logic
- **Updated App.js routing** - Removed old global window state dependency
- **Root path handling** - Explicit route for "/" that checks authentication properly

### 5. **Added Debug Information**
- **Login Page Debug Panel** - Shows current auth state, session token, and remember me status
- **Dashboard Debug Panel** - Shows session status with hot reload testing indicators
- **Console Logging** - Comprehensive logging throughout the auth flow

## How to Test üß™

### **Testing Session Persistence During Hot Reload:**

1. **Start the app**: `npm run electron:dev`

2. **Go to Login Page**: Navigate to `/authentication/login`
   - You'll see a debug panel showing current auth state
   - Should show "No current user" initially

3. **Login with Any Credentials**: 
   - Username: `test` (any username)
   - Password: `password` (any password) 
   - Make sure "Remember Me" is checked
   - Click "Sign In"

4. **Check Dashboard**: 
   - Should redirect to dashboard after login
   - Top of dashboard shows green debug panel with session status
   - Should show "Logged In" and "Remember Me: On"

5. **Test Hot Reload**:
   - Make a small change to any React file (add a comment)
   - Save the file to trigger hot reload
   - **RESULT**: User should stay logged in - debug panel should still show "Logged In"

6. **Test Full Refresh**:
   - Press `Cmd+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+R` (Windows) to refresh the page
   - **RESULT**: User should stay logged in if "Remember Me" was enabled

### **What to Look For:**

‚úÖ **SUCCESS INDICATORS:**
- Debug panel shows "Logged In" after hot reload
- Session token remains the same (first 10 characters shown)
- No redirect to login page
- Console shows "Session restored successfully" messages

‚ùå **FAILURE INDICATORS:**
- Redirected back to login page after hot reload
- Debug panel shows "Not Logged In"
- Console shows "Failed to restore session" errors

## Debug Information Available

### **Login Page Debug Panel:**
```
Debug - Auth State:
Current User: [username or None]
Session Token: [first 10 chars]... or None
Remember Me: Yes/No
```

### **Dashboard Debug Panel:**
```
üîê Session Status (Hot Reload Test)
[Logged In/Not Logged In] [Remember Me: On/Off]
User: [username] | Session: [token preview] | Last Login: [date]
```

### **Console Logs:**
- `ParseInitializer:` - Parse SDK initialization
- `AuthGuard:` - Authentication state checks and navigation
- `ParseAuth:` - Login/logout operations
- `LOGIN PAGE -` - Login page auth state checks

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Initial Load**: User sees login page, debug shows no current user
2. **After Login**: User redirected to dashboard, debug shows logged in status
3. **Hot Reload**: Page updates, user stays on dashboard, debug shows logged in status  
4. **Full Refresh**: Page reloads, user stays on dashboard (if remember me enabled)
5. **Session Expiry**: If session invalid, user redirected to login with error cleanup

## Files Modified

- `src/components/AuthGuard.js` - Complete rewrite with proper React state management
- `src/components/ParseInitializer.js` - Removed redundant session restoration 
- `src/services/parseService.js` - Default remember me, better logging
- `src/layouts/authentication/login/index.js` - Added debug information
- `src/layouts/dashboard/index.js` - Added session status monitoring
- `src/components/AuthenticatedRedirect.js` - **NEW** - Proper startup redirect logic
- `src/App.js` - **FIXED** - Updated routing to use new authentication logic

## Notes

- **Debug panels only show in development mode** - They won't appear in production
- **Remember Me is now enabled by default** - Better user experience
- **Enhanced error handling** - Invalid session tokens are cleaned up automatically
- **Better logging** - All components have prefixed console messages for easier debugging

## Next Steps

If users are still not staying logged in after these fixes:

1. Check browser console for any error messages
2. Verify Parse Server is running and accessible  
3. Check if session tokens are being stored in localStorage
4. Test with different browsers to rule out browser-specific issues
5. Check Parse Server logs for authentication errors

The debug panels will help you identify exactly where the issue is occurring in the authentication flow.
