      "description": "Add a descriptive console.log statement to the toggleTheme function in the ThemeToggle component to log theme changes. This will help with debugging and provide immediate visual feedback when testing the theme toggle functionality. The log should include both the current theme state and the target theme state to provide comprehensive debugging information.",
      "notes": "This follows the project's established console.log patterns found in ParseInitializer, AdminCreator, and service files. The log message uses a descriptive format with component prefix for easy identification. This is a safe modification that only adds debugging information without changing any functionality.",

      "implementationGuide": "1. Open the file src/components/ThemeToggle/index.js\\n2. Locate the toggleTheme function (around line 18)\\n3. Add a console.log statement as the first line of the function:\\n   console.log('ThemeToggle: Switching theme from', darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light', 'to', !darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light');\\n4. Ensure the existing setDarkMode call remains unchanged\\n5. Save the file\\n\\nThe function should look like:\\nconst toggleTheme = () => {\\n  console.log('ThemeToggle: Switching theme from', darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light', 'to', !darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light');\\n  setDarkMode(dispatch, !darkMode);\\n};",
      "verificationCriteria": "1. Open browser developer console\\n2. Navigate to a page with the theme toggle component\\n3. Click the theme toggle button\\n4. Verify console message appears with format: 'ThemeToggle: Switching theme from [current] to [target]'\\n5. Confirm the theme actually changes in the UI\\n6. Test multiple toggles to ensure consistent logging\\n7. Verify no syntax errors or console errors are introduced\\n8. Confirm the existing theme switching functionality remains unchanged",
      "analysisResult": "Create a simple test task to verify the mcp-shrimp-task-manager functionality is working correctly. This task involves adding a console.log statement to the ThemeToggle component to provide debugging information when users switch between light and dark themes. The task follows established project patterns and provides immediate, verifiable results for testing the task management workflow.",
      "summary": "Task completed successfully. Added console.log statement to ThemeToggle component's toggleTheme function as specified. The implementation follows project patterns with descriptive logging format including component prefix and both current and target theme states. Code modification is minimal, safe, and maintains existing functionality while adding useful debugging information.",
