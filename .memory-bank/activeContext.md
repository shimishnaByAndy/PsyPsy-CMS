## Current Focus: UI Component Refinement

The current development focus is on refining the UI components, particularly the navigation bar and user management interfaces. We're working on streamlining the user experience by removing unnecessary elements and optimizing the interface for the primary user flows.

### Navbar Customization

We've recently made significant changes to the DashboardNavbar component:

1. **Removed Redundant Icons**:
   - Eliminated notification icon
   - Removed settings icon
   - Removed account icon
   - Removed hamburger menu icon
   - Removed breadcrumbs

2. **Layout Optimization**:
   - Adjusted the navbar sizing to be more appropriate
   - Changed styling to better integrate with the rest of the UI
   - Optimized the navbar specially for the users table page

3. **Component Integration**:
   - Integrated UserTypeSelector component for filtering users
   - Ensured proper styling and layout within the navbar
   - Made the component responsive and visually consistent

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Removed unused event handlers and state
   - Streamlined component rendering
   - Eliminated unnecessary re-renders

### User Type Selector

The UserTypeSelector component has been implemented to provide filtering functionality for the users table:

1. **Functionality**:
   - Allows filtering users by type (All, Professionals, Clients, Admins)
   - Persists selection in localStorage
   - Triggers parent component callback when selection changes

2. **UI Implementation**:
   - Uses React Icons for visual indicators
   - Custom styling to match application theme
   - Responsive design that adapts to container width

3. **Integration**:
   - Integrated with Tables layout
   - Properly positioned in the DashboardNavbar for users page
   - Connected to data filtering logic

### Current Implementation Challenges

1. **React Icons Integration**:
   - Had to install react-icons package with legacy peer dependencies
   - Resolved dependency conflicts

2. **Navbar Layout Issues**:
   - Addressed positioning problems that caused the navbar to go off-screen
   - Fine-tuned the dimensions and styling for proper display

3. **Component Communication**:
   - Implemented proper props passing between DashboardNavbar and Tables components
   - Ensured the UserTypeSelector component properly communicates selected filters

### Next Steps

1. **User Interface Refinement**:
   - Further refine the navbar styling for consistency
   - Improve responsive behavior on different screen sizes
   - Ensure accessibility standards are met

2. **User Management Features**:
   - Enhance the data displayed in the users table
   - Implement additional filtering options
   - Add user detail view functionality

3. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Test user type filtering with actual data
   - Validate proper display across devices
   - Ensure smooth user experience when switching between views
