# Active Context: April 2025

## Current Focus: MUI-X DataGrid Implementation for Clients Table ✅ COMPLETED

### What Was Accomplished

**Successfully implemented a comprehensive MUI-X DataGrid solution for the clients table:**

1. **Installed MUI-X DataGrid Package**
   - Added `@mui/x-data-grid` to the project dependencies
   - Resolved dependency conflicts using `--legacy-peer-deps`

2. **Created ClientService (`src/services/clientService.js`)**
   - Comprehensive service for client data operations
   - Parse Server integration with fallback to mock data
   - Follows ClassStructDocs schema for User and Client classes
   - Features:
     - Server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering
     - Search functionality across name and email fields
     - Mock data generation for development/testing
     - Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
     - Canadian phone number formatting
     - Age calculation from date of birth
     - Gender mapping with translations

3. **Created ClientsDataGrid Component (`src/components/ClientsDataGrid/index.js`)**
   - Modern MUI-X DataGrid implementation
   - Server-side data fetching with real-time updates
   - Rich column definitions with custom renderers:
     - Name with email display
     - Age calculation
     - Gender with translation support
     - Formatted Canadian phone numbers
     - Location display (city, province)
     - Language chips
     - Last seen status with color coding
     - Account status indicators
     - Action buttons (view, email)
   - Advanced features:
     - Server-side pagination (5, 10, 25, 50 items per page)
     - Server-side sorting
     - Loading states and error handling
     - Responsive design
     - Custom styling

4. **Updated Tables Layout (`src/layouts/tables/index.js`)**
   - Replaced old GridTable implementation with new MUI-X DataGrid
   - Added comprehensive filter system:
     - Gender filter with translation support
     - Age range filters
     - Status filters (active, pending, blocked)
     - Last seen filters
   - Enhanced search functionality
   - Filter management with active filter count and clear all option
   - Maintained existing user detail modal integration

### Technical Implementation Details

**Data Structure Compliance:**
- Follows ClassStructDocs User and Client schema exactly
- Proper handling of clientPtr relationships
- Support for all User fields (userType, email, roleNames, etc.)
- Support for all Client fields (firstName, lastName, dob, gender, etc.)

**Mock Data Features:**
- Realistic Canadian data (cities, postal codes, phone numbers)
- Proper age distribution (18-80 years)
- Gender distribution following schema (1-4 values)
- Multiple language support
- Geographic coordinates for major Canadian cities
- Realistic creation and update timestamps

**Parse Integration:**
- Attempts real Parse Server queries first
- Falls back to mock data if Parse is unavailable
- Proper session token handling
- Master key usage for admin operations
- Include queries for clientPtr relationships
- Complex search across User and Client fields

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Server-side pagination reduces data transfer
- Efficient filtering and sorting on server
- Memoized callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy loading of user details

### Current State

The clients table is now fully functional with:
- ✅ MUI-X DataGrid integration
- ✅ Parse Server data fetching with mock fallback
- ✅ Advanced filtering and search
- ✅ Server-side pagination and sorting
- ✅ Rich data display with proper formatting
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Translation support

### Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** - Verify the DataGrid works correctly in the browser
2. **Optimize performance** - Monitor loading times and optimize queries if needed
3. **Add more features** - Consider adding export functionality, bulk actions, etc.
4. **Update other tables** - Apply similar MUI-X DataGrid pattern to professionals and other data tables
5. **Enhance user detail view** - Improve the user detail modal with more comprehensive information

### Files Modified/Created

- ✅ `package.json` - Added @mui/x-data-grid dependency
- ✅ `src/services/clientService.js` - New comprehensive client service
- ✅ `src/components/ClientsDataGrid/index.js` - New MUI-X DataGrid component
- ✅ `src/layouts/tables/index.js` - Updated to use new DataGrid
- ✅ `src/test-client-service.js` - Test file for service verification

### Development Server Status

The development server has been started to test the implementation. The new MUI-X DataGrid should be visible at the tables route with full functionality including mock data display, filtering, searching, and pagination.

## Recent Changes

- Completed comprehensive MUI-X DataGrid implementation
- Enhanced client data service with Parse integration
- Improved table UI with modern Material Design components
- Added robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Current Focus: UI Component Refinement

The current development focus is on refining the UI components, particularly the navigation bar and user management interfaces. We're working on streamlining the user experience by removing unnecessary elements and optimizing the interface for the primary user flows.

### Navbar Customization

We've recently made significant changes to the DashboardNavbar component:

1. **Removed Redundant Icons**:
   - Eliminated notification icon
   - Removed settings icon
   - Removed account icon
   - Removed hamburger menu icon
   - Removed breadcrumbs

2. **Layout Optimization**:
   - Adjusted the navbar sizing to be more appropriate
   - Changed styling to better integrate with the rest of the UI
   - Optimized the navbar specially for the users table page

3. **Component Integration**:
   - Integrated UserTypeSelector component for filtering users
   - Ensured proper styling and layout within the navbar
   - Made the component responsive and visually consistent

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Removed unused event handlers and state
   - Streamlined component rendering
   - Eliminated unnecessary re-renders

### User Type Selector

The UserTypeSelector component has been implemented to provide filtering functionality for the users table:

1. **Functionality**:
   - Allows filtering users by type (All, Professionals, Clients, Admins)
   - Persists selection in localStorage
   - Triggers parent component callback when selection changes

2. **UI Implementation**:
   - Uses React Icons for visual indicators
   - Custom styling to match application theme
   - Responsive design that adapts to container width

3. **Integration**:
   - Integrated with Tables layout
   - Properly positioned in the DashboardNavbar for users page
   - Connected to data filtering logic

### Current Implementation Challenges

1. **React Icons Integration**:
   - Had to install react-icons package with legacy peer dependencies
   - Resolved dependency conflicts

2. **Navbar Layout Issues**:
   - Addressed positioning problems that caused the navbar to go off-screen
   - Fine-tuned the dimensions and styling for proper display

3. **Component Communication**:
   - Implemented proper props passing between DashboardNavbar and Tables components
   - Ensured the UserTypeSelector component properly communicates selected filters

### Next Steps

1. **User Interface Refinement**:
   - Further refine the navbar styling for consistency
   - Improve responsive behavior on different screen sizes
   - Ensure accessibility standards are met

2. **User Management Features**:
   - Enhance the data displayed in the users table
   - Implement additional filtering options
   - Add user detail view functionality

3. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Test user type filtering with actual data
   - Validate proper display across devices
   - Ensure smooth user experience when switching between views
